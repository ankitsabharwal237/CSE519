# Model Building

The problem was quite challenging because the subtleties in this data are a bit hard to guage. 

	- Primarily reason being, the entrie task hinges on predicting the errors of a blackbox model 
that is in business for sometime.
	- Secondly most of the intutive features one may thing are important indicators of prices of 
housings are scarce.
	- Third there are composite data as well as simple data. Like some columns as in Zip code are 
good enough to infer city, region, state, neigbourhood etc., so there is redundancy.
	- Categorical variables itself makes me quite un-comfortable, so the flood of such variables 
was a bit jarring so to say.
